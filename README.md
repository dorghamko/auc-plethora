This is a keepsake repo; the platform for which Plethora was built, [Project Looking Glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Looking_Glass), is a now inactive!

## What is Plethora?
Plethora is the perfect complement/companion to Sun Microsystem's Project Looking Glass. Designed as a NetBeans module suite, Plethora allows 3D application developers to create 3D interfaces that combine utility and visual appeal. The user is given full reign over a wide range of features that are bound to prove extremely useful in the course of developing applications for the LG3D platform.

Plethora supports LG3D shapes, Java 3D-based objects, model loaders, and a variety of widget sets. You can easily extend components and add new components.

### What does Plethora provide?
* Drag-n-Drop enabled Designer
* Automatic Code Generation
* Components Inspector for 3D-Shapes Hierarchy
* Property Sheets for Supported Shapes
* Event-Handling Support
* Rich Widget Set (Working on it!)
* Mouse and Keyboard Control in the Designer (try the right and left mouse buttons, and the numpad)
* Loading Object Models (.obj files)
* Configuration File (.lgcfg) Support
* 2D Panels Support (SwingNodes)

### How do you build a LG3D project using Plethora?
You use our module suite for NetBeans in order to design and build your project. Afterwards, all you have to do is simply put the generated .jar file in the LG3D applications' folder (ext/app). Pretty soon, we'll even do that for you!
