-->

<!---
    The root node of the document.
    Frame must contain a Properties element, a NonVisualElements element,
    a Layout element, and a Components element in that order.
    id is always fixed to "this" to maintain a reference to the generated class object which will make code generation
    easier.
-->

<!ELEMENT Frame (Properties, NonVisualElements, Layout, Components)>
<!ATTLIST Frame
    id CDATA #FIXED "this"
>

<!---
   The Properties element for the Frame;
   it is divided into simple properties and complex properties.
   The set method is used to set both types of properites in the generated code.
-->

<!ELEMENT Properties (SimpleProperty|ComplexProperty)*>

<!--- 
    The Simple Property does not require an object to be created first, and it can only take one value.
    Example: foo.setHeight(10.4f); 
-->

<!ELEMENT SimpleProperty EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST SimpleProperty
    name CDATA #REQUIRED
    type CDATA #REQUIRED
    value CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!---
    The Complex Property requires an object to be created first with the listed parameters before using
    the set method.
    The name attribute is the name of the property to be set.
    The type is the class type of the object to be created.
-->

<!ELEMENT ComplexProperty (Parameters)>
<!ATTLIST ComplexProperty
    name CDATA #REQUIRED
    type CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!--- 
    Parameters element define a set of paramters to be sent to the constructor of an object.
-->

<!ELEMENT Parameters (SimpleParameter|ComplexParameter)*>

<!--- 
    SimpleParameter element encapsulates the value of the parameter passed to a constructor.
-->

<!ELEMENT SimpleParameter EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST SimpleParameter
    type CDATA #REQUIRED
    value CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!---
    The Complex Parameter requires an object to be created first with the listed parameters before using
    the constructor.
    The name attribute is the name of the property to be set.
    The type is the class type of the object to be created.
-->

<!ELEMENT ComplexParameter (Parameters)>
<!ATTLIST ComplexParameter
    type CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!--- 
   Non Visual Components are a set of elements that would represents components that are used by elements of the frame
   but do not appear in the desginer such as appearance.
-->

<!ELEMENT NonVisualElements (Element)*>

<!--- 
    Element defines a class object that can be used either as a visual element in a component such as a sphere
    or as a non-visual element such as appearance.
    The value of the id attribute is unique and represents the element's variable name.
    The type attribute defines the class type of the element.
-->

<!ELEMENT Element ((Parameters, Properties)|(Properties, Parameters))>
<!ATTLIST Element
    id ID #REQUIRED
    type CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!--- 
  Layout describes the hierarchy of components and containers.
-->

<!ELEMENT Layout (ContainerRef|ComponentRef)*>

<!--- 
    ContainerRef represents a reference to a container and describes its layout.
    A container can encompass an infinte depth of containers and components.
    The ref attribute must reference an existing unique id attribute of a container.
-->

<!ELEMENT ContainerRef (ContainerRef|ComponentRef)*>
<!ATTLIST ContainerRef
    ref IDREF #REQUIRED
>

<!--- 
    ComponentRef represents a reference to a component.
    The ref attribute must reference an existing unique id attribute of a component.
-->

<!ELEMENT ComponentRef EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST ComponentRef
    ref IDREF #REQUIRED
>

<!--- 
    Components represents a set of components and containers (Visual Components).
-->

<!ELEMENT Components (Container|Component)*>

<!--- 
    Container defines a Container3D object with its properties and event handlers.
    The value of the id attribute is unique and represents the container's variable name.
    The id attribute is referenced by ContainerRef's ref attribute in the Layout.
    The type attribute defines the class type of the container.
-->

<!ELEMENT Container (Properties, EventHandlers)>
<!ATTLIST Container
    id ID #REQUIRED
    type CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!--- 
    Component defines a Component3D object with its properties, event handlers, and element.
    The value of the id attribute is unique and represents the component's variable name.
    This id is referenced by ComponentRef's ref attribute.
    The type attribute defines the class type of the component.
-->

<!ELEMENT Component (Properties, EventHandlers, Element)>
<!ATTLIST Component
    id ID #REQUIRED
    type CDATA #REQUIRED
>

<!--- 
   EventHandlers represents a group of event handlers that are defined on a component or a container.
-->

<!ELEMENT EventHandlers (EventHandler)*>

<!--- 
   EventHandler defines an event handler that handles an event on a component or a container.
   The value of the event attribute represents the name of the target event class.
   The value of the handler attribute represents the name of the function to which the event is propagated;
   this value must be unique since it is a function name.
-->

<!ELEMENT EventHandler EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST EventHandler
    name CDATA #REQUIRED
    event CDATA #REQUIRED
    handler ID #REQUIRED
